Today was the birth of ElpEnterprises.  Elp is a non-regular expression meaning Elp,-like praxis.
This company/institution/philosophical position is in an amorphous state at the moment but one thing
is certain:  Elp will not shy away from grandeur.  In our first FateOfMiddleEarth, a tech tree was
established, denoting some of the goals and ponderings of Elp.  Everything from a generalized app
creating service, to a generalized paradigm for presenting scientific data.  To achieve these
technologies, a more anthropomorphic data structure needs to be established, which understands its
own relations to its fellow objects in a dynamic way which has the power to change its own ontology.
The first tasks were doled as the philosophy of elp began to present itself in the collective of its
founders.  A new world order is upon us, to make sense of web*.0 and its relation to us, or rather
our relation to it.

...we ready ourselves.  sharpen our tools and stretch the mind.  Irony and Sincerity live not on a
line, but a great circle, and meet at infinityâ„¢.
